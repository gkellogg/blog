I just released version 0.1.0 of the [rdfa_parser_gem][1]. This parser is written in Ruby and uses Nokogiri XML parsing. It passes all XHTML1 test cases and most of the existing test cases for HTML4 and HTML5.

The gem is based on previous work done by Ben Adida and some libraries borrowed from the [Reddy Gem][2].

The project is hosted on [GitHub][3], feel free to clone. You can try out the parser through a [distiller][4].
