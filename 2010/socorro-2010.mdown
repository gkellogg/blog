Just got back from [Socorro and associated islands.][1] We dove off of the [Solmar V][2], a very nice dive boat operating out of Cabo San Lucas. I got some wonderful pictures of a friendly Giant Manta Rey who did several fly overs during the course of one dive off San Benedicto Island.

My picks for the best pictures of the trip can be found [here][3]. More pictures, including people and several sequences of Manta fly overs can be found [here][4].

Also, I uploaded a [slide show][5] made from the the [Socorro photo album][4] I recently published. Enjoy.
