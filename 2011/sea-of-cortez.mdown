I just returned from a week on the [Rocio del Mar][1] diving the northern Sea of Cortez (aka the [Gulf of California][2]). We dove along the [Midriff Islands][3] and had great encounters with Sperm Whales and Whale Sharks, not to mention the often over-exhuberant Sea Lions. Check out the [photos][4].
