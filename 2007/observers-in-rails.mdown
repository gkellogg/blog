Thanks to [Rick Olson](http://weblog.techno-weenie.net) for providing assistance with the proper syntax for instantiating observers in Rails 1.2. The old way was to add an _observer_ statement to the appropriate controller, such as:

    observer :user_observer

Hidden in the ignored parts of `conf/environment.rb` was the proper notation:

    # Activate observers that should always be running
    # config.active_record.observers = :cacher, :garbage_collector

This makes the last of my deprecation messages go away!
