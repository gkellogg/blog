Just got back from Wakatobi, in Indonesia near Bali. Great diving, with fantastic reefs. I got some nice shots, I think you'll see. The primary album is [Wakatobi 2008][1] with a separate album of the wonderful [people][2] that I traveled with or encountered. A Youtube video slideshow can be found [here][3].
