[Here][1] are photos from our weekend at Nick's Cove in Tamales Bay with Jen & Ty. The first 9 are from a trip I took there in 2002, well before it was restored. The rest are from the other day. The place you see in the first photo, is actually the "Big Rock" villa we stayed in, before renovation. The Warf has been completely rebuilt and extended. Still very picturesque.
